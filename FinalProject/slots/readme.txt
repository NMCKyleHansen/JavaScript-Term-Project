## Description 
The slots game allows the player to play a vegas style slot machine until they run out of coins. 
Once they run out of coins they can restart or leave the game.

## directions
Use the "spin to win" button to start the slot machine turning after you enter a bet. 
The default bet is 1 coin. However you are allowed to increase your bet to 3 coins. 
The payout rules are as follows:

Payout Rules
************
3 in a row = 10*bet
2 in a row = 2*bet

## problems or issues
The game currently has no issues that I have detected. 
It did have an issue with determining the results of the spin, but that was resolved.  

## plans to resolve the problems or issues
None at the moment. 

## plans for future releases
I currently do not have plans for future releases during this class. 
However, if I do expand on this game in the future I will add more wheel images. 
The game currently has 'orange.png','cherry.png','banana.png', and last but not least 'plum.png'
