## Description 
Submarine Obstacle Adventure(Submarine) is a game for kids to navigate the obstacles hidden in the depths of the sea. 
This game uses the HTML canvas and JavaScript.

## directions
Use the "Up", "Down", "Forward", and "Back" buttons to help to submarine avoid dangerous obstacles.

## problems or issues
The game currently has no real issues. I may work on adjusting the obstacle hitbox in the future. 
The hitbox is a rectangle. However, the actual sub has a periscope on top, which makes the top higher than the rest of the sub. 

## plans to resolve the problems or issues
None at the moment. I may make the entirety of the periscope out of the hitbox. 
However, I am not sure if that will make the game more believable or not. 

## plans for future releases
I currently do not have plans for future releases. However, if I do expand on this game 
I will probably add an additional obstacle of a giant jellyfish or something similar.
